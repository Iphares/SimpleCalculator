The Arithemtic library https://github.com/bdholloway/SENG-560 is very well layedout and easy to integrate. Integration was simple by simply including the required header files into my project and then building. Documentation was clear and concise, very much what I would expect from a arithmetic library designed with reusability in mind. The overall design allows the library to be easily extendable and modular, dependencies within the library are clean and lightweight. The library comes with a set of unit tests that test the functionality of all functionality within it. 

Overall this library was a good fit for my simple calculator application, it provided all the functions needed to support basic arithemtic for Real, Hexadecimals, Octal, and Binary numbers.
